# ace-editor-bower
A bower implementation and registry for ace editor

# Usage

`bower install ace-editor-bower`

# Why

Currently Cloud9 doesn't support the ace editor in bower. The other places I have found running this in bower are out of date. Thus I am going to host a version of it myself!

Open an issue to request a new version to be added, that's the quickest way to get my attention.

Current Version: 1.2.2
