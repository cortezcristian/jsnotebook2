# jsnotebook2

**Rationale**

Notes help us think, document, experiment and play with ideas. That's the main reason for creating this project. I'm a big fan of jupyter notebooks, gists, pastebins and cloud documents but I'm still searching for something better to comunicate, express myself and save my JS notes.

**Installation**

I recommend you install the command line cli-tool to have a better experience:

```
$ npm i -g jsnotebook2
$ jsnotebook2
```

**Examples**

- Insert math formulas, like the following: `\sum i = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n`
- Execute javascript code rows by pressing `shift+enter` during edition, you can repeat this operation multiple times and receive the updated`stdout`, `stderr`
- To take the most out of the experience you might consider looking into markdown and mathjax language references

**Usage**

Here's a basic description of the capabilities

- Select the row type and hit the plus (+) button on the toolbar to create new rows: Markdown, Mathajax, Code
- You can use the arrow keys (`up` and `down`) to move between cells, hit `shift+enter` for edition and `esc` to escape edition mode
- The row selected will be highlighted in `blue` and the cell under edition in `green`
- You can move rows to a different position in the document, using the up <i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> and down <i class="fa fa-arrow-down"> </i> buttons in the tool bar
- Also you can perform cut <i class="fa fa-cut"></i>, copy <i class="fa fa-files-o"></i>, paste <i class="fa fa-paste"></i> and remove <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> operations on the selected row
- Notebook can be printed <i class="fa fa-print"></i> and source code be downloaded as json by clicking the download button <i class="fa fa-download"></i>
- All of your changes are automatically persisted to your browser local storage
- Click the save floppy disk button <i class="fa fa-floppy-o"></i> to **restore a previous session** or copy source to your clipboard
